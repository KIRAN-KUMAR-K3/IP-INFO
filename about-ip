An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a unique numerical identifier assigned to every device connected to a computer network, including devices on the internet. It's like a physical address for your device in the vast digital world. IP addresses serve two main purposes:

1. **Network Interface Identification:** IP addresses identify the specific network interface of a device, allowing for communication between devices on the same network.

2. **Location Addressing:** IP addresses also provide the location of a device within the global internet, enabling data packets to be routed to the correct destination.

There are two primary versions of IP addresses in use today:

1. **IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4):** The older and more widely used version, represented by four dotted decimal numbers (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

2. **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6):** The newer and more expansive version, represented by eight hexadecimal groups separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

IP addresses are essential for the functioning of the internet, enabling seamless communication and data transfer between devices worldwide.
